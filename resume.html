                        Designed detail Flight Testing and Wind Tunnel Testing Program with critical path, risk management and resource allocation planning with initial flight testing hypothesis testings. Repeatedly communicated with the OEM Aircraft Designer, Australia OEM Representative, client and other general aviation LAME for information and analysis for potential modification. Generated CAD model and analysed it through CFD software. Designed various modifications and tested with CFD program which were validated with Wind Tunnel Testings. Manufactured design parts which were accepted and certified with an OEM Letter of Approval. Tested design in-flight with a resulting 100% improvement at cruise phrase and a significant improvement during off-design flying conditions and profiles. Impressive comment made by former RAAF Test Pilot and OEM engineers.
