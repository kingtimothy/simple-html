        <h1>Hello World! - HTML5</h1>
        Here is a brunch of HTML5 new tags those are apparently less useful.
        
        <br /> <br />
        <header>
            <nav>
                This is a Nav Tag.
            </nav>
        </header>
        <br/> and this &lt;nav&gt; tag isn't meant to do anything. (So what's the point?)
        <br/> <br/> There is also a footer tag which does the exact same thing without the tag.
        <br/> <br/> Other tags are called wrap and article tag.
        <br/> <br/> But there is one new tag that actually do something - video tag.
        
        <br/> <br/> 
        <video width="480" controls>
            <source src="intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video.
        </video>
        
        <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
        Go to 
        <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>.
        <br /> <br />    
        <footer>
